# Earthquake Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning can be used to analyze earthquake data and identify short-term seismic risk patterns.

## Objective
To determine whether recent seismic activity can be used to classify short-term earthquake risk using historical data.

## Data Source
- USGS Earthquake Catalog (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- `data/` – earthquake datasets
- `notebooks/` – data analysis and modeling
- `images/` – generated graphs
- `presentation/` – PowerPoint slides

## Disclaimer
This project does not predict exact earthquakes. It explores statistical patterns in seismic activity for educational purposes only.
